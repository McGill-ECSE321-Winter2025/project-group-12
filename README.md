# Boadr (Group 12)

Welcome to the **Boadr** repository! This project is designed to create a platform for board game lovers to connect, share their games, and organize events. Whether you're a **Player** or a **Game Owner**, this app will help you manage your board game experiences seamlessly.

## Project Overview

The app supports two types of accounts:
- **Players**: Can browse games, review them, and participate in events.
- **Game Owners**: Can manage their board game collections, receive borrowing requests, and track lending history.

### Key Features:
- **User Authentication**: Users must log in to access the app's features.
- **Personal Account Page**: Displays account type, name, owned games (for Game Owners), and event participation history.
- **Game Management**: Game Owners can manage their collections, accept/decline borrowing requests, and track lending history.
- **Event Creation**: Users can create events with details like date, time, location, description, maximum participants, and the board game to be played.
- **Event Registration**: Users can register for events if slots are available.
- **Game Browsing**: All users can browse a list of available board games, see reviews, and check ownership details.
